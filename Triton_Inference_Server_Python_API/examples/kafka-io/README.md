# Triton Inference Server Kafka I/O Deployment

Using the Triton Inference Server In-Process Python API you can
integrate triton server based models into any Python framework
to consume the messages from a Kafka topic and produce the inference results
back to the kafka topic of choice.

This directory contains an example Triton Inference Server
deployment based on Kafka I/O that uses threads for each of server, consumer and producer.

| [Installation](#installation) | [Run Deployment](#starting-the-pipeline) | [Send Requests](#send-requests-to-deployment) |


## Installation

In this Kafka I/O pipeline we deploy a pre-processing stage of tokenization based on `transformers` tokenization module and can be extended to any type of models as needed.


### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tutorials.git
cd tutorials/Triton_Inference_Server_Python_API/examples/kafka-io
```

### Install dependencies

Please note the following command will take many minutes depending on
your hardware configuration and network connection.


```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If triton server is not already installed, install the dependency by using the following command.

```bash
pip install /opt/tritonserver/python/tritonserver-2.44.0-py3-none-any.whl
```


## Starting the pipeline

### Start Container

Start the pipeline using the following command once you have logged into the triton container

```bash
python tritonserver_deployment.py --consumer_config="{\"bootstrap.servers\": \"<brokers>\", \"sasl.mechanisms\": \"OAUTHBEARER\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.method\": \"oidc\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.scope\": \"<scope>\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.client.id\": \"<client_id>\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.client.secret\": \"<client_secret>\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\": \"<token_url>\", \"security.protocol\": \"SASL_SSL\"}" --producer_config="{\"bootstrap.servers\": \"<brokers>\", \"sasl.mechanisms\": \"OAUTHBEARER\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.method\": \"oidc\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.scope\": \"<scope>\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.client.id\": \"<client_id>\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.client.secret\": \"<client_secret>\", \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\": \"<token_url>\", \"security.protocol\": \"SASL_SSL\"}" --consumer_topics="<input_topic>" --producer_topic="output_topic" --model_repository="<model_repository>"
```

*Note: In the above command we have used Consumer and Producer to have OIDC based authentication with the Kafka brokers, these settings can be changed to meet the Kafka connection requirements based on your infrastructure.*

## Send Requests to Deployment

In order to send requests to inference pipeline deployed, produce messages into the input kafka topic.

In our example, we ingest the following data `this is test message - new {str(i)}` in a loop


#### Example Output
Once the workflow consumes the ingested messages from the kafka topic, it invokes the triton server and produces the inference output as `json` string to the output kafka topic. Once the message has been ingested, we should see an output message displayed on the console indicating that the message has been pushed to the topic.

```bash
User record successfully produced to <output-topic> [1] at offset 0
```

Since, our example has a tokenizer deployed as a custom model in triton, we should see an output inserted into kafka topic as shown below.

```bash
